# [tree-of-color](https://reed-cstar.github.io/tree-of-color/)

CSTAR's RF2025 display.

## for the curious

The web demo runs [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) (a port of [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython) to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)) on a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) (to avoid python execution from blocking the main thread) and communicates using
[stdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)) and [stderr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)) (to allow users to use stdout for printing debug info to the console) (the format is detailed in the [tree of color's py library's specification](https://github.com/Reed-CSTAR/tree-of-color/tree/main/py#readme)) over web worker messaging.

We refer to the web worker running Pyodide as the "daemon" (which is why it is described this way whenever you press "Kill"). The "Stop" command does not kill the web worker: instead, because of [a Pyodide limitation](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/discussions/4670) (and to avoid building our version of Pyodide that supports asynchronous promises in its standard streams), the python script listens to a special keyword where it will terminate the program if it gets it. Sometimes, (e.g. through an infinite loop), the Python program does not hear this message and therefore needs to be entirely restarted from the web worker level. 

This website was made with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/). The terminal emulator is powered by [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/). The (incredibly out-of-style) toasts are by [svelte-french-toast](https://svelte-french-toast.com/), and other libraries are described in [`package.json`](https://github.com/Reed-CSTAR/tree-of-color/blob/main/package.json).

## using other languages

As long as your program conforms to the specification listed: https://github.com/Reed-CSTAR/tree-of-color/tree/main/py#readme and isn't difficult to run (if you are using some non-standard language like `TASM`, please give us a reasonably reproducible environment! These scripts will be running on a feeble Raspberry PI), we may be able to support itâ€”but please don't wait until the tree of color is about to be deployed!
